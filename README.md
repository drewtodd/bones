# Bones

Bones is a minimal, bare-bones theme for starting a Hugo site. There are no styles, no layout, just basic functionality to help you get started quickly.

## Usage

To use Bones, clone this repository into your `themes` directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/drewtodd/bones.git themes/bones
```

Then, in your site's `config.toml`, set the `theme` field to `"bones"`:

```
theme = "bones"
```

## Installation

1. Clone the Bones theme:
```
git submodule add https://github.com/drewtodd/bones.git themes/bones
```

2. Update your `config.toml`:
```
theme = "bones"
```

3. Run your Hugo site:
```
hugo server
```

You should now have a functioning Hugo site with basic functionality. Please note that this theme is intentionally unstyled and bare-bones to give you complete control over the design.
