# Bones

Bones is a very bare-bones theme for starting out a Hugo site. There are no styles, no layout, just basic functionality.

## Usage

To use Bones, simply clone this repository into your `themes` directory:

```
bash
git clone https://github.com/drewtodd/bones.git
```

Then, in your site's `config.toml`, set the `theme` field to `"bones"`:

```
theme = "bones"
```

You should now have a functioning Hugo site with basic functionality. Please note that this theme is intentionally unstyled and bare-bones.
